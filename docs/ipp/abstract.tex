Each programming language, database platform, ETL system and data
analysis software has distinct methods for implementing extraction and
loading (ingestion) logic. Lacking is a system that can be used
interchangeably across different formats and tools. A user-friendly
system for declaring data ingestion can have several use cases, some of
which are as follows: (1) less time spent writing code to extract, load,
move or convert data; (2) easily swap a pipeline from one datastore to
another; (3) Seamlessly migrate data projects from in-process to
physical storage; and (4) generate data lineage directly from the
configuration.
