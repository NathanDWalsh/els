With data playing a central role in today's organizations, there is
lacking a human-readable language for defining data sources and targets.
Each programming language, database platform, ETL system and data
interaction software has its own language and procedures for
implementing extraction and loading, but there lacks a general method
that can be used interchangeable across different formats and tools. A
common language for communicating the extract-load portion of the
pipeline can have several use cases, some being the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Less time spent writing code to extract, load, move or convert data.
\item
  Easily move a pipeline from one system to another, for example to be
  able to test pipelines on a different database systems.
\item
  Seamlessly migrate analysis projects from in-process analysis (pandas)
  to BI tools.
\item
  Generate data lineage directly from the configuration.
\end{itemize}
